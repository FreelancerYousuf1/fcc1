      <ul>
        <li><b>Early life and background:</b> <hr>Ram Charan was born in Madras (now Chennai) to Telugu film actor Chiranjeevi and his wife Surekha on 27 March 1985.[2] He has two sisters. He is the grandson of Allu Ramalingaiah and the nephew of Nagendra Babu, Pawan Kalyan, and Allu Aravind.

He was educated at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan, Chennai,[4] Lawrence School, Lovedale,[5] The Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet[6] and at St. Mary's College, Hyderabad.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>2007:</b> <hr>In 2007, Charan made his film debut as the leading actor in Chirutha, which was directed by Puri Jagannadh and completed 50 days in 178 direct centers and 15 other shifted centers. The film completed 100 days in 40 direct centers.[8] He played the role of Charan, an ex-convict who is hell-bent on killing the murderer of his father. Rediff.com praised his performance stating: "Ram Charan is quite promising. Dance and action appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also stays clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue or adopting any particular mannerism or style."[9] His performance in the film earned him a Filmfare Best South Debutant Award and Nandi Special Jury Award.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>2009:</b><hr>After the release of the 2009 film Magadheera, which was only his second film, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, Charan established himself as one of the leading contemporary actors of Tollywood. He played dual roles in this film in which one is a brave soldier of a kingdom in Rajasthan in the 17th century in love with the princess but loses her and dies, the other a bike racer who falls in love with a girl who is the reincarnation of the princess and wins her knowing their past. His portrayal got immense critical acclaim. The Times of India wrote: "Ram Charan returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. He showcases his horse-riding and dancing skills to perfection."[11] IndiaGlitz commented: "Charan has come up with a mature performance and he has carried the film very well. Both his characters were done justice and he reminded of his father at many places."[12] The film received six Filmfare Awards including the award for Filmfare Award for Best Actor â€“ Telugu and Nandi Special Jury Award for Charan.</li>
